Each clipboard is identified by a name encoded as a `gdk::Atom`. (Conversion to and from strings can be done with `gdk::Atom_::intern` and `gdk::Atom_::name`.) The default clipboard corresponds to the “CLIPBOARD” atom; another commonly used clipboard is the “PRIMARY” clipboard, which, in X, traditionally contains the currently selected text."]]});
