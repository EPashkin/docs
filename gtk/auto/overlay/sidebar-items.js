initSidebarItems({"struct":[["Overlay","`Overlay` is a container which contains a single main child, on top of which it can place “overlay” widgets. The position of each overlay widget is determined by its `Widget:halign` and `Widget:valign` properties. E.g. a widget with both alignments set to `Align::Start` will be placed at the top left corner of the main widget, whereas an overlay with halign set to `Align::Center` and valign set to `Align::End` will be placed a the bottom edge of the main widget, horizontally centered. The position can be adjusted by setting the margin properties of the child to non-zero values."]]});
