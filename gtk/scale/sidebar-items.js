To use it, youâ€™ll probably want to investigate the methods on its base class, `Range`, in addition to the methods for `Scale` itself. To set the value of a scale, you would normally use `RangeExt::set_value`. To detect changes to the value, you would normally use the `Range::value-changed` signal."]]});
