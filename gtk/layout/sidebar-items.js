initSidebarItems({"struct":[["Layout","`Layout` is similar to `DrawingArea` in that it’s a “blank slate” and doesn’t do anything but paint a blank background by default. It's different in that it supports scrolling natively (you can add it to a `ScrolledWindow`), and it can contain child widgets, since it’s a `Container`. However if you’re just going to draw, a `DrawingArea` is a better choice since it has lower overhead."]]});
