initSidebarItems({"struct":[["PopoverMenu","`PopoverMenu` is a subclass of `Popover` that treats its childen like menus and allows switching between them. It is meant to be used primarily together with `ModelButton`, but any widget can be used, such as `SpinButton` or `Scale`. In this respect, `PopoverMenu` is more flexible than popovers that are created from a `gio::MenuModel` with `Popover::new_from_model`."]]});
